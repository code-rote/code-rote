DESCRIPTION: Remember the sing-a-long songs that a certain purple dinosaur would use to make routine activities like [cleaning up](http://youtu.be/PJhXVg2QisM?t=7s) and [brusing your teeth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5lu0BlBGno) fun-fun for every-one? Before you knew what hit you, the room was clean and you were well on your way to a lifetime of healthy, happy living, right? Now it's time to pay it forward and sprinkle a little bit of that Dino's Magical Purple Stuff onto your coding experience... POOF! cODE-ROTe just materialized out of thin air, Lucky you! [Who loves you???](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq734_nZ7Eo) 

DESCRIPTION: The goal is to build a 'read-a-long' && 'type-a-long' adventure game that makes leveling-up your developer skills fun instead of a chore. It is targeted at people with 6 mo to 1 yr of coding experience. Each course is structured and sequenced to build an app, one snippet at a time (the 'type-a-long'), in addition we integrate high-quality notes into the gaming process (the 'read-a-long'). Combined this allows a player to gain the benefits of ROTE learning for both the physical, mental, and procedural processes. Helping to build a more natural mind-body connection for aspiring devs.

DESCRIPTION: cODE-ROTe is NOT just a physical exercise. At it's core it promises both mental exercise and learning by rote.

DESCRIPTION: Helping coders learn faster by gamifying learning by Rote 

## HOW TO START ##
1. Clone GitHub repo
2. Pull down dependencies with Bundler and Bower `bundle install` && `bower install`
3. Start server with `rails s`


# Key Take-Aways
  >* Do not include a 'framework' of any size unless you read AT LEAST the first section of documentation, and really, AT LEAST the first page... __README's aren't just a "convention"__. Respect the effort that was put into the library and save yourself HOURS of debugging down the road. _(SEE: Bootstrap's container vs container-fluid for a good example.)_
  >* __Gold-plating is the devil__, especially when you dont even have silver plates yet. Meaning, finish the core before you move on to anything more.
  >* Libraries can rewrite what you do (i.e. break something that you "fixed", or "break" something new).
