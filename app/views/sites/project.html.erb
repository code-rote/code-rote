  <em>It never ceases to amaze me. Just when I thought that we were supposed to be practicing what we've learned instead of learning something new by building our projects - WHAM! We are hit with a special little `gem` from GA.</em>

        UX sees all things from the value or perception of the user. I am painting in broad strokes, of course, but the bottom line is that after speaking with the UXDI group that I REALLY need to step back and see the BIG picture (not the BIG technical/architectural picture) but the real purpose of why we build what we build… to answer the Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Recognize that a feature is: “having killer-notes that help the user learn while they play the game”</strong> is more valuable to help with prioritization than a feature being “We can allow Users to authenticate with their favorite provider and they won’t have to bitch about passwords, plus we won’t have to support them with passwords either…” What true VALUE does OAUTH have for the user? Does it MAKE them WANT to use your product? No. It makes it EASIER to gain ACCESS to use your product. The key here is that I was missing the whole MVP idea: to “sketch” a product idea in hi-fi. I am not supposed to worry about OAUTH - I am supposed to identify the key differentiators of my SKETCH (what makes it worth looking at/paying attention to) and do my damnedest to make them a reality. 
      </p>

        After all, who cares how many ways someone can sign-in or how many integrations you have if NOONE wants to actually use your product.
